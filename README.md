# React Assignment

## Background

GammaSwap is a way to borrow liquidity from any pool in any AMM. This could be as a way to hedge an LP position or get leveraged option like exposure to a token.

We will be connecting to various AMMs and need to display the stats of that pool for LPs to assess whether they would like to provide liquidity. Typical information they look at is the tokens comprising the pair, the APR, fees, etc

This will one of many components you would potentially implement as a front end engineer at GammaSwap

## Assignment

Implement this light mode Figma design for a pool in React [https://www.figma.com/file/ftOxVjTkK6LKC7Tk4sH6sQ/GammaSwap-Assignment?node-id=1092-44491&t=XAi0T4J3h9ZhALmv-0](https://www.figma.com/file/ftOxVjTkK6LKC7Tk4sH6sQ/GammaSwap-Assignment?node-id=1092-44491&t=XAi0T4J3h9ZhALmv-0)

In addition to whatâ€™s required, you are free to add any animations or effects that make the component come to life.

### What we look for

- Keen attention to detail. Strong ability to think of edge cases that may be important for the user.
- Strong ability to handle complex state management inside components.
- Good code hygiene and deep understanding of codebase maintenance for mid-to-large sized projects
- Document different aspects of your code so that other engineers can easily understand different functions, etc.
- Ability to implement components in React from Figma designs accurately
